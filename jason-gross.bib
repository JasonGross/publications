  Abstract                 = {We report on the development of the \emph{{HoTT} library}, a formalization of homotopy type theory in the {Coq} proof assistant. It formalizes most of basic homotopy type theory, including univalence, higher inductive types, and significant amounts of synthetic homotopy theory, as well as category theory and modalities. The library has been used as a basis for several independent developments. We discuss the decisions that led to the design of the library, and we comment on the interaction of homotopy type theory with recently introduced features of {Coq}, such as universe polymorphism and private inductive types.},

  Abstract                 = {We present Fiat, a library for the Coq proof assistant supporting refinement of declarative specifications into efficient functional programs with a high degree of automation. Each refinement process leaves a proof trail, checkable by the normal Coq kernel, justifying its soundness. We focus on the synthesis of abstract data types that package methods with private data. We demonstrate the utility of our framework by applying it to the synthesis of \textit{query structures} -- abstract data types with SQL-like query and insert operations. Fiat includes a library for writing specifications of query structures in SQL-inspired notation, expressing operations over relations (tables) in terms of mathematical sets. This library includes a set of tactics for automating the refinement of these specifications into efficient, correct-by-construction OCaml code. Using these tactics, a programmer can generate such an implementation completely automatically by only specifying the equivalent of SQL indexes, data structures capturing useful views of the abstract data. We conclude by speculating on the new programming modularity possibilities enabled by an automated refinement system with proved-correct rules.},

We further demonstrate that simple partial evaluation is sufficient to transform into the fastest-known C code, breaking the decades-old pattern that the only fast implementations are those whose instruction-level steps were written out by hand.

These techniques were used to build an elliptic-curve library that achieves competitive performance for 80 prime fields and multiple CPU architectures, showing that implementation and proof effort scales with the number and complexity of conceptually different algorithms, not their use cases.
As one outcome, we present the first verified high-performance implementation of P-256, the most widely used elliptic curve.
Implementations from our library were included in BoringSSL to replace existing specialized code, for inclusion in several large deployments for Chrome, Android, and CloudFlare.},

A significant amount of work has gone into ensuring that the library compiles quickly. This talk will discuss the various constructions in the HoTT library, as well as the design choices and features, both of Coq and of univalent type theory, which allow our library to compile and typecheck quickly.},

The ability to switch from Gallina to Ltac in arbitrary locations nicely complements the \texttt{constr:}~notation permitting the switch from Ltac to Gallina in tactics, and opens up many new possibilities. I propose to present three tricks involving these new features: tactics in terms allows the construction of tactics that recurse under binders; tactics in terms together with typeclasses allows overloading notations based on the type of their arguments; and there is a way to talk about universe levels explicitly, helped along by tactics in terms.},

In this paper, we share the lessons we have learned about how to represent very abstract mathematical objects and arguments in Coq and how future proof assistants might be designed to better support such reasoning. One particular encoding trick to which we draw attention allows category-theoretic arguments involving \emph{duality} to be internalized in Coq's logic with definitional equality. Ours may be the largest Coq development to date that uses the relatively new Coq version developed by homotopy type theorists, and we reflect on which new features were especially helpful.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new strategy for performing reification in Coq.
That is, we show how to generate first-class abstract syntax trees from ``native'' terms of Coq's logic, suitable as inputs to verified compilers or procedures in the \emph{proof-by-reflection} style.
Our new strategy, based on simple generalization of subterms as variables, is straightforward, short, and fast.
In its pure form, it is only complete for constants and function applications, but ``let'' binders, eliminators, lambdas, and quantifiers can be accommodated through lightweight coding conventions or preprocessing.

We survey the existing methods of reification across multiple Coq metaprogramming facilities, describing various design choices and tricks that can be used to speed them up, as well as various limitations.
We report benchmarking results for 18 variants, in addition to our own, finding that our own reification outperforms 16 of these methods in all cases, and one additional method in some cases; writing an OCaml plugin is the only method tested to be faster.
Our method is the most concise of the strategies we considered, reifying terms using only two to four lines of \texttt{Ltac}---beyond lists of the identifiers to reify and their reified variants.
Additionally, our strategy automatically provides error messages that are no less helpful than Coq's own error messages.},

  Abstract                 = {People can learn visual concepts from just one example, but it remains a mystery how this is accomplished. Many authors have proposed that transferred knowledge from more familiar concepts is a route to one shot learning, but what is the form of this abstract knowledge? One hypothesis is that the sharing of parts is core to one shot learning, and we evaluate this idea in the domain of handwritten characters, using a massive new dataset. These simple visual concepts have a rich internal part structure, yet they are particularly tractable for computational models. We introduce a generative model of how characters are composed from strokes, where knowledge from previous characters helps to infer the latent strokes in novel characters. The stroke model outperforms a competing state-of-the-art character model on a challenging one shot learning task, and it provides a good fit to human perceptual data.},
